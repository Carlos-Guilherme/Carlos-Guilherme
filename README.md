### Hi there, i'm Carlos Guilherme 👋

Hello, I am a 21-year-old programmer who has been programming in Python for 3 years. I have experience in creating automation systems, chatbots with artificial intelligence, cryptography, security tools, graphical interfaces, data analysis systems and systems with SQL databases.

In addition, I have developed websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Although I have never worked in the field professionally, I am eager to find my first job and apply my skills to challenging and innovative projects.

I am a technology enthusiast and I am always looking for new ways to improve my skills and knowledge. I am dedicated, proactive, and have great teamwork skills, always seeking to collaborate for the success of the project.

If you are looking for a professional with these skills, committed and willing to contribute to the growth of your company, please contact me! I am excited to be part of your team.
